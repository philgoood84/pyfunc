# pyfunc
Python with functional features
Me playing around functional ideas and trying to understand the whole concept
I know people have made it better and smarter (dry-python, result.py...)
Not the best at testing my code, not responsible if crash

Intention
    Build usual containers for functional programming (Maybe, List, Result, Reader, Writer, State...)
    I don't want to write typeclass in python, I only want to write functors, applicatives, monads function for each type


Learn a lot from a number of sources from which :
    Typeclassopedia (https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia)
    result.py on github
    ...
    More to come as I learn new ideas
